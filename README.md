# TON Copilot Dataset

## Project Overview

TON Copilot Dataset is an initiative to create a comprehensive and continuously updated dataset for training Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in the Telegram Open Network (TON) ecosystem. This dataset aims to serve as a foundation for developing AI-powered assistants and tools that can effectively support developers, users, and enthusiasts within the TON ecosystem.

## Key Features

1. Multi-source Data Collection
   - Official documentation
   - GitHub repositories
   - Telegram group messages

2. Continuous Updates
   - Automated data ingestion from various sources
   - Regular refresh cycles to maintain relevance

3. Domain-specific Focus
   - Tailored for TON ecosystem expertise
   - Covers smart contracts, blockchain architecture, and TON-specific protocols

## Methodology for Building a Domain-Specific LLM Dataset

1. Source Identification
   - Identify authoritative and relevant data sources
   - Ensure diverse representation of content types

2. Data Collection
   - Implement web scraping for documentation and GitHub repos
   - Utilize Telegram API for group message extraction
   - Establish data collection frequency and update mechanisms

3. Data Preprocessing
   - Clean and normalize text data
   - Remove duplicates and irrelevant content
   - Standardize formatting across different sources

4. Data Annotation
   - Develop a tagging system for content categorization
   - Implement named entity recognition for TON-specific terms
   - Create a glossary of domain-specific terminology

5. Quality Assurance
   - Establish manual review processes for data accuracy
   - Implement automated checks for data integrity
   - Regularly validate dataset against expert knowledge

6. Version Control
   - Maintain dataset versioning for traceability
   - Document changes and updates between versions

7. Ethical Considerations
   - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
   - Obtain necessary permissions for data usage
   - Anonymize personal information in Telegram messages

8. Scalability Planning
   - Design data pipeline for handling increasing data volumes
   - Implement efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms

9. Evaluation Metrics
   - Develop benchmarks for assessing dataset quality
   - Create test sets for evaluating LLM performance on TON-specific tasks

10. Community Engagement
    - Establish feedback loops with TON developers and users
    - Incorporate community contributions and corrections

By following this methodology, the TON Copilot Dataset project aims to create a high-quality, domain-specific dataset that will enable the development of advanced AI models tailored to the TON ecosystem.
